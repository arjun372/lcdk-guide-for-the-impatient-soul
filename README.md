# Performance oriented design on the LCDK

*** Please refer to the individual folders above. ***

## TODO (*will vanish upon completion*)
* [ ] System Overview
* [x] Âµ-benchmark tutorial
* [x] Faster Math Ops with MATHLIB
* [x] Efficient FFTs with DSPLIB
* [x] Optimizing Neural Nets using DSPLIB
* [ ] Interfacing a 9-DOF over I2C
* [ ] Running Linux on the LCDK


## Goals for this guide
* Write trivially reproducible code
* Groundwork for creating a collaborative toolkit for EE113D folk
* Exploring LCDK system capabilities & limitations
* Sharing lessons learned
* Introduction to performance oriented design
* Good design practices for low-memory, high-compute capability devices


// ** IN PROGRESS **
